## Task Description

- [ ] Research and decide on the best interface for CrewAI to interact with Obsidian (e.g., `mcp-obsidian` plugin, `Obsidian Local REST API` plugin, or a combination).
- [ ] Define the specific project management capabilities the CrewAI agent should have (e.g., creating tasks, updating statuses, querying tasks, summarizing project progress).
- [ ] Develop custom CrewAI tools that wrap the chosen Obsidian interface/API calls.
- [ ] Design and implement CrewAI agent(s) and task(s) for Obsidian project management.
- [ ] Test and refine the CrewAI PM system.

## Notes

This task is for creating an AI assistant that can actively help manage projects within this Obsidian vault. It will leverage programmatic access to Obsidian.
